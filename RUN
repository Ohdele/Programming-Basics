To run these examples:

Copy the entire modified script for the example you want to try.
Paste it into a new file in Visual Studio Code (or any text editor).
Save the file with a .py extension, for example, calculator.py.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the file using the cd command.
Run the script using the python command followed by the file name:
bash
Copy code
python calculator.py
Replace calculator.py with the name of the file you saved.
These examples now have hardcoded values, so you can see the program flow and the output directly in the terminal without needing to input values. If you want to change the values or test different scenarios, you can modify the values in the scripts as indicated.
